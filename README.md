# Space_Flappy_Engine
An alternative version of the famous flappy bird game. Created using Pygame.

Instead of a flappy bird, this game uses a Rocket Car in a Cosmic environment. It has a wide computer resolution rather than Flappy Bird which uses a mobile phone 
resolution. Because of a mobile phone based resolution, flappy bird game had to deal with one set of pipes at a time, which was easier but this game deals woth multiple
sets of pipes at a time.

Enjoy!

Instructions (You might know these already):
1. Press <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Up</kbd> to switch on the boost in your rocket.
2. Once you hit a the ground or the roof or hit a pipe, Game Over.
